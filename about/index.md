I'm a graduate student from University of Minnesota (Class 2020). This blog is to document my 🎒analytics study journey, and mostly, shower thoughts. Read with caution.

### So... how was this site built?

With blood and tears. :grimacing:

This is a ~~[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)~~ [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site, hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I am working on migrating it to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) though. It was built  after months of procrastination and hours upon hours of pressing ⌘-⇧-R, resizing windows ploughing through documentation, googling and of course, some actual coding.
