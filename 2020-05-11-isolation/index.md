I think yesterday was a Friday because someone used _#flashbackfriday_ but every day brings painful flashbacks.  I miss the hustle and bustle of a crowded crossroad. I miss sitting on a seat and it's still warm and then kind of feels wet and you're not entirely sure but you've already committed to that seat and then finally when you get up you think yeah it was wet.

The world never was my oyster and now I can barely make my playground further than 20 yards from me. But I miss roaming around going through airport security and having the agents say 'have a good flight', and I say, 'you too'.   



Did I recognize that last time I would be introduced to a stranger and immediately forget their name within 30 seconds? I think she said she worked for a cafe. Was she Nancy, maybe Nicole. I'm pretty sure it started with an N but to be honest I really wasn't listening.

How naive I was on those dates in a bar with a live band and I'm trying to tell a story but then the song ends and it gets really quiet and I'm still yelling in his ear. And those moments when I recognized someone and made eye contact with but then played it off like I didn't see them.  Would you know what I was thinking? Like your body is your mind in isolation. 

I'll never know.
