Honestly, I don’t care what we do tonight. We could go out and get drinks, or grab some beer and stay in. We could check out that new Japanese place we’ve been meaning to try, or just swing by that Mexican place by the river. We could make Chinese as always. We could get pizza on the patio. We could pound down a two-gallon bucket of tzatziki sauce in the back of my shity Dodge Journey. Burgers.  Bowls. Seriously, whatever.

But do you even really want to see a movie? We could sit back and browse Netflix. We could curl up on the couch with Amazon Prime. I also have Hulu and FilmStruck and Crackle, but no, I do not have an opinion. Keep in mind, these are only simultaneously vague and highly-specific suggestions I feel lukewarmly about.

I want to drink a little tonight but only if you want to, too, and if you don’t then me neither; Whiskey’s cool, I don’t even need a mixer. Should I pick up some Diet Coke or something while I’m at the store? I am an emotional ghost.

I’m down to clown. I’m down to drown. I’m up for anything and everything or nothing or something or *The Theory of Everything*. There are three arts festivals in Uptown this weekend, but I am not suggesting that we go to any of them. I am a cognitive ascetic. My will is a feather and the night is a wind. I am the one exception to the stimulus-response question on the ACT.



Okay, but when was the last time we sat down and talked? You know—really hashed it out. Told each other everything, no barriers. Isn’t that an activity in itself? Why go do “anything” when we have our own world, our own universe, right here.



Or, why don't we just be with ourselves instead?
