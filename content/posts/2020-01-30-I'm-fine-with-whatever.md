Honestly, I don’t care what we do tonight. We could go out and get drinks, or grab some beer and stay in. We could check out that new Japanese place we’ve been meaning to try, or just swing by that Mexican place by the river. We could make Chinese as always. We could get pizza on the patio. We could pound down a two-gallon bucket of tzatziki sauce in the back of the car. Burgers. Fries. Seriously, whatever.

But do you even really want to see a movie? We could sit back and browse whatever, but no, I do not have an opinion, not today. Keep in mind, these are only simultaneously vague and highly-specific suggestions I feel lukewarmly about.

I want to drink a little tonight but only if you want to, too, and if you don’t then me neither; Whiskey’s cool, I don’t even need a mixer. Should I pick up some Diet Coke or something while I’m at the store? I am an emotional ghost.

I’m down to clown. I’m down to drown. I’m up for anything and everything or nothing. Okay, but when was the last time we sat down and talked? You know, really hashed it out. Told each other everything, no barriers. Isn’t that an activity in itself? Why go do “anything” when we have our own world, our own universe, right here.

Or, why don't we just be with ourselves instead?  

Hey, why so serious? Just an old shower thought I'm rambling about here.
