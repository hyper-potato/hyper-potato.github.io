      <description>Sit tight and listen to music
For the past weeks, I’ve taken breaks from staring blankly into the middle distance to dip deeper into my playlists than I have in years.
I’m using Spotify only since last year here and there, most of time I use apple music as the main source of music. I like the feature of adding songs to library on apple music. By innertion I’m still using the library to save songs that I like.</description>
